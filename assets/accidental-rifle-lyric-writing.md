# Accidental Rifle Lyric Writing

I let Suno generate lyrics on its own three times, then took the best bits and adjusted things here and there.

## Suno Song 1

[Verse]
Isaiah walked into the fair that night,
With dust on his boots and stars in sight.
Dropped a ten-dollar bill on a whim so light,
Didn’t know his luck’d take such a flight.

[Verse 2]
The raffle man hollered, "The winner's name,
Isaiah Jenkins! Step up and claim!"
A shiny new rifle, his prize to keep,
Though his jaw hit the floor, he couldn’t speak.

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed, said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.

[Verse 3]
Folks gathered 'round, “Boy, take your prize!
Luck like that ain’t no disguise.”
Isaiah muttered, “This ain’t my plan,
But I reckon fate’s got a steadier hand.”

[Verse 4]
He walked back home past the mesquite trees,
Crickets sang in the night-time breeze.
He told his ma what the raffle brought,
She laughed, “Son, it’s a gift you ain’t even sought.”

[Bridge]
Now it leans in the corner, gathering dust,
Isaiah ain’t the kind to break the rust.
But every time fate tips his hat,
He thinks of the night he walked home with that.


## Suno Song 2

[Verse]
Isaiah Franka signed his name, just for a piece of pie,
At a county fair in Texas, 'neath that wide and open sky.
He thought it'd be a fruitcake or a gift card to the mall,
But they handed him a rifle, the strangest prize of all.

[Verse 2]
He stood there in his boots, blinking in the sun,
Holding that cold metal he'd no clue how to run.
"No hunting history, ma'am," he said with a grin,
"But I'll take it—I’m guessing I oughta learn to win."

[Chorus]
How strange the twists of fate in this old dusty town,
A man can seek a pie and get a rifle handed down.
In a world of lonesome chances, it’s the little things you find,
Like a raffle and a rifle that can up and change your mind.

[Verse 3]
His neighbors gathered 'round him, laughing by the stand,
"Look who’s armed and dangerous now," a farmer shook his hand.
Isaiah smiled and nodded, took the teasing like a champ,
But truth was he felt foolish, not hardened, tough, or damp.

[Bridge]
He placed it on his mantle, like a cowboy’s wildest dream,
Though he shot at just tin cans down by the running stream.
Life moves in crazy circles, that’s the lesson for the day,
A raffle for dessert, a rifle comes your way.

[Chorus]
How strange the twists of fate in this old dusty town,
A man can seek a pie and get a rifle handed down.
In a world of lonesome chances, it’s the little things you find,
Like a raffle and a rifle that can up and change your mind.


## Suno Song 3

[Verse]
Isaiah Franka walked into the hall,
In a dusty ol' town where time seemed to crawl.
Paid five bucks for a ticket, just for a lark,
Never dreamed it'd light up his world with a spark.

[Verse 2]
The numbers were called, his name rang out,
He turned to the crowd, a slow, stunned shout.
In his hands was a rifle, cold iron and wood,
And he thought, "This ain't gonna end like it should."

[Chorus]
He said, "I ain't no hunter, I ain't no shot,
And what am I supposed to do with this I just got?
A raffle in Texas, now I’m a man with a gun,
This world does strange things just for fun."

[Verse 3]
He walked out slow, folks cheered and clapped,
That Winchester gleamed like a trap gets snapped.
He stared at it hard in the evening light,
Thinking, sometimes fate don't get it right.

[Verse 4]
Back at his truck, he sat on the tail,
The sunset painted the sky so pale.
Somewhere a coyote let out a cry,
And Isaiah just shook his head with a sigh.

[Chorus]
He said, "I ain't no hunter, I ain't no shot,
And what am I supposed to do with this I just got?
A raffle in Texas, now I’m a man with a gun,
This world does strange things just for fun."


## Song Combined

[Verse]
A man walked into the county fair,
With joy in his heart and barbecue in the air.
Somehow his name got into the raffle,
and his mind was about to be baffled.

[Verse 2]
The raffle man hollered, "The winner's name,
is Isaiah Franka! Step up and claim!"
A shiny new rifle, his prize to keep,
His jaw hit the floor, he couldn’t speak.

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed and said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.

[Verse 3]
Folks gathered 'round, “Boy, take your prize!
Luck like that ain’t no disguise.”
Isaiah muttered, “This ain’t my plan,
But I reckon fate’s got a steadier hand.”

[Verse 4]
He said, "I ain't no hunter, I ain't no shot,
what am I supposed to do with this thing I just got?
A raffle in Texas, now I’m a man with a gun,
It doesn't quite feel like I've really won."

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed and said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.

[Bridge]
Now it leans in the corner, gathering dust,
Isaiah ain’t the kind to break the rust.
But every time fate tips his hat,
He thinks of the day he walked home with that.

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed and said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.
