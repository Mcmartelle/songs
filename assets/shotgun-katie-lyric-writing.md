# Suno Song 1

[Verse]
In the Colorado twilight, where the mountains meet the plains,
Shotgun Katie takes her station, 'neath the sky that never rains.
With her old .22 and a weathered wooden chair,
She guards her feathered family with a mother's tender care.

[Verse 2]
In the backyard shadows, by the coop, near the shed,
She watches the horizon, where the vermin dare to tread.
Coyote calls and raccoon eyes, lurking in the night,
But Katie stands her ground, ready for the fight.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, sittin' in the yard,
Protecting all her chickens, never lets down her guard.
From sunset to sunrise, she's awake and on patrol,
She keeps those critters at bay with her brave and steady soul.

[Verse 3]
The wind it whispers softly through the pines and sagebrush green,
Katie hums an old tune, where no trouble's ever seen.
But in the deepest darkness, you can hear a coyote cry,
She loads another shell and keeps her aim high.

[Verse 4]
Neighbors call her crazy, but they don't quite understand,
Katie's bound by duty, and she’ll rise to any stand.
With every cluck and crow, she knows her kin are safe inside,
With steady hands, she won’t let danger slide.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, sittin' in the yard,
Protecting all her chickens, never lets down her guard.
From sunset to sunrise, she's awake and on patrol,
She keeps those critters at bay with her brave and steady soul.


# Suno Song 2

[Verse]
Shotgun Katie sits out back, watchin' the stars align,
Colorado night so still, not a cloud in sight or sign,
Raccoons and coyotes lurking, shadows on the ground,
Katie’s keeping vigil, never makin' a sound.

[Verse 2]
Chickens roostin’ cozy, in their little coop,
Katie’s on that porch swing, ready for the swoop,
Hand on that ol' shotgun, she knows what to do,
Guardin' those hens, just like she promised to.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, fearless and strong,
In the Colorado night, she belongs,
Keepin' them safe, all through the dark,
Protectin' her chickens with her brave heart.

[Verse 3]
Moonlight casts a silver glow, across the rugged land,
Katie’s eyes are sharp as steel, gun tight in her hand,
Rustlin’ in the bushes, a threat she won’t allow,
In this backyard battle, she’s the queen of the now.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, fearless and strong,
In the Colorado night, she belongs,
Keepin' them safe, all through the dark,
Protectin' her chickens with her brave heart.

[Bridge]
Memories of her daddy, taught her well and true,
Showed her how to handle a rifle when the danger grew,
Now she stands alone, in the chill of the night,
Katie, with her shotgun, ready for a fight.


# Suno Song 3

[Verse]
Shotgun Katie's sitting in the backyard,
Guardin' those chickens with a heart of steel,
Raccoons and coyotes, they ain't gonna get far,
Under Colorado’s moon, she's behind the wheel.

[Verse 2]
The night gets quiet, and the stars so bright,
Katie hears the whisper of the midnight breeze,
She’s got an old .22, ready for a fight,
Those predators are savvy, but she ain't easily deceived.

[Chorus]
Katie's out there, under the starlit skies,
The chickens rest easy, no fear in their eyes,
In the heart of Colorado, with a fire that won't subside,
Shotgun Katie stands firm, she’s ready to ride.

[Verse 3]
Her daddy taught her young, how to use that gun,
Said the land won't defend itself, gotta stay strong,
From dusk till dawn, she’s the only one,
To keep the homestead safe, where she belongs.

[Verse 4]
Out there in the Rockies, where the wild things roam,
Katie’s there fighting with unwavering pride,
She found her calling, her true home,
Protecting the flock with her at their side.

[Chorus]
Katie's out there, under the starlit skies,
The chickens rest easy, no fear in their eyes,
In the heart of Colorado, with a fire that won't subside,
Shotgun Katie stands firm, she’s ready to ride.


# Combined Lyrics

[Verse]
In the Colorado twilight, where the plains and mountains meet,
Shotgun Katie takes her station, as her chickens cluck and tweet.
With her old 12 gauge and a weathered wooden chair,
She guards her feathered family with a mother's tender care.

[Verse 2]
In the backyard shadows, by the coop, near the shed,
She watches the horizon, where the vermin dare to tread.
Coyote calls and raccoon eyes, lurking in the night,
But Katie stands her ground, ready for the fight.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, sittin' in the yard,
Protecting all her chickens, never lets down her guard.
From sunset to sunrise, she's awake and on patrol,
She keeps those critters at bay with her brave and steady soul.

[Verse 3]
Neighbors call her crazy, but they understand her not,
Katie's bound by duty, they don't know what she's fought.
Hand on that ol' shotgun, she knows what to do,
Guardin' those hens, just like she promised to.

[Bridge]
Memories of her daddy, taught her well and true,
Showed her how to handle a rifle when the danger grew,
Raccoons and coyotes lurking, shadows on the ground,
Katie’s keeping vigil, never makin' a sound.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, sittin' in the yard,
Protecting all her chickens, never lets down her guard.
From sunset to sunrise, she's awake and on patrol,
She keeps those critters at bay with her brave and steady soul.
