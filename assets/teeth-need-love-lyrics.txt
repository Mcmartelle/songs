[Verse 1]
A pea-sized dollop on the bristle ride
Morning smiles are open wide
A soldier's march left right left right
Morning breath soon takes flight

[Chorus]
The front the back the gaps the sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
Gentle circles on every tooth
Your glowing smile is the proof

[Verse 2]
Before you snooze and close your eyes
Make your teeth twinkle like fireflies
Donâ€™t forget the molars in the back
Brush and shine stay on track

[Chorus]
The front the back the gaps the sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
Gentle circles on every tooth
Your glowing smile is the proof

[Bridge]
Two minutes twice a day
Keeping cavities away
Clean your chompers true
Your chompers will chew chew
Chew chew chew chew CHEW!

[Chorus]
The front the back the gaps the sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
Gentle circles on every tooth
Your glowing smile is the proof
