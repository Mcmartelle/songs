# Teeth Need Love Lyric Writing

I asked Grok to generate lyrics. Used Grok Deepsearch to get dentist recommendation facts. Had Suno generate its own lyrics. Combined all that into one song.


# Grok's Lyrics

Brushing Teeth Song

[Chorus]
Brush, brush, brush your teeth,
Every morning, every night,
Keep them clean, make them bright!

[Verse 1]
Hold your brush at an angle right,
Brush in circles, not too tight,
Gently clean, with all your might!

[Verse 2]
Brush the front, brush the back,
Molars too, in the back,
All around, don’t be slack!

[Verse 3]
Two minutes is the time to spend,
Use a timer, it’s your friend,
Brush until the very end!

[Chorus]
Brush, brush, brush your teeth,
Every morning, every night,
Keep them clean, make them bright!


# Suno Lyrics 1

[Verse]
The mirror stares back like it knows my sins
The battle begins where the minty war wins
Foam armies rise as the bristles spin

[Prechorus]
Left right left right a soldier's march
Morning breath meets its minty arch

[Chorus]
Brush it up brush it down
Let the toothpaste wear the crown
Minty fresh like a tidal wave
Every tooth is a kingdom saved

[Verse 2]
Plaque’s on the run as the bubbles roar
Electric rhythm on the bathroom floor
Rinse and repeat then we’re ready for more

[Bridge]
Spin cycle spin cycle the rhythm takes hold
Mint storm mint storm fierce and bold
No retreat no surrender to the grime of old

[Chorus]
Brush it up brush it down
Let the toothpaste wear the crown
Minty fresh like a tidal wave
Every tooth is a kingdom saved


# Suno Lyrics 2

[Verse]
The toothbrush is your magic wand
Swish and swirl
You're in command
Up and down
Round and back
Chase those germs
Keep 'em on track

[Chorus]
Brush those pearly whites
Yeah
Yeah
Don't let the sugar bugs stay
Nah nah
Front to back
Side to side
Make your smile the world's delight

[Verse 2]
Don't forget the molars in the rear
They need love
Let them hear
Scrub-a-dub
Rinse the foam
Shiny teeth
You're not alone

[Prechorus]
Minty fresh
Oh
Feel the breeze
Say goodbye to cavities

[Chorus]
Brush those pearly whites
Yeah
Yeah
Don't let the sugar bugs stay
Nah nah
Front to back
Side to side
Make your smile the world's delight

[Bridge]
Bassline drops
The rhythm pops
Brush
Brush
Don't ever stop
Feel the beat
The bristles sing
Healthy teeth are everything

# Suno Lyrics from Refined Prompt

[Verse 1]
Wake up sleepyhead it’s time to rise
Grab your brush and toothpaste surprise
A pea-sized dollop on the bristle ride
Morning smiles are open wide

[Chorus]
Brush and shine it’s two-minute time
Round and round and up we climb
Don’t forget the molars in the back
Brush and shine stay on track

[Verse 2]
Before you snooze and close your eyes
Make your teeth twinkle like fireflies
Gentle circles no need to race
Your toothbrush is your happy face

[Chorus]
Brush and shine it’s two-minute time
Round and round and up we climb
Don’t forget the molars in the back
Brush and shine stay on track

[Bridge]
The front the back the tops and sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
A little scrub a little care
A healthy smile everywhere

[Chorus]
Brush and shine it’s two-minute time
Round and round and up we climb
Don’t forget the molars in the back
Brush and shine stay on track

[Verse 1]
A pea-sized dollop on the bristle ride
Morning smiles are open wide
A soldier's march left right left right
Morning breath soon takes flight

[Chorus]
The front the back the gaps the sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
Gentle circles on every tooth
Your glowing smile is the proof

[Verse 2]
Before you snooze and close your eyes
Make your teeth twinkle like fireflies
Don’t forget the molars in the back
Brush and shine stay on track

[Chorus]
The front the back the gaps the sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
Gentle circles on every tooth
Your glowing smile is the proof

[Bridge]
Two minutes twice a day
Keeping cavities away
Clean your chompers true
Your chompers will chew chew
Chew chew chew chew CHEW!

[Chorus]
The front the back the gaps the sides
Your teeth need love where food hides
Gentle circles on every tooth
Your glowing smile is the proof

Every tooth brush brush
