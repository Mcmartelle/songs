[Verse]
In the Colorado twilight, where the plains and mountains meet,
Shotgun Katie takes her station, as her chickens cluck and tweet.
With her old 12 gauge and a weathered wooden chair,
She guards her feathered family with a mother's tender care.

[Verse 2]
In the backyard shadows, by the coop, near the shed,
She watches the horizon, where the vermin dare to tread.
Coyote calls and raccoon eyes, lurking in the night,
But Katie stands her ground, ready for the fight.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, sittin' in the yard,
Protecting all her chickens, never lets down her guard.
From sunset to sunrise, she's awake and on patrol,
She keeps those critters at bay with her brave and steady soul.

[Verse 3]
Neighbors call her crazy, but they understand her not,
Katie's bound by duty, they don't know what she's fought.
Hand on that ol' shotgun, she knows what to do,
Guardin' those hens, just like she promised to.

[Bridge]
Memories of her daddy, taught her well and true,
Showed her how to handle a rifle when the danger grew,
Raccoons and coyotes lurking, shadows on the ground,
Katieâ€™s keeping vigil, never makin' a sound.

[Chorus]
Shotgun Katie, sittin' in the yard,
Protecting all her chickens, never lets down her guard.
From sunset to sunrise, she's awake and on patrol,
She keeps those critters at bay with her brave and steady soul.
