[Verse]
A man walked into the county fair,
With joy in his heart and barbecue in the air.
Somehow his name got into the raffle,
and his mind was about to be baffled.

[Verse 2]
The raffle man hollered, "The winner's name,
is Isaiah Franka! Step up and claim!"
A shiny new rifle, his prize to keep,
His jaw hit the floor, he couldn’t speak.

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed and said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.

[Verse 3]
Folks gathered 'round, “Boy, take your prize!
Luck like that ain’t no disguise.”
Isaiah muttered, “This ain’t my plan,
But I reckon fate’s got a steadier hand.”

[Verse 4]
He said, "I ain't no hunter, I ain't no shot,
what am I supposed to do with this thing I just got?
A raffle in Texas, now I’m a man with a gun,
It doesn't quite feel like I've really won."

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed and said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.

[Bridge]
Now it leans in the corner, gathering dust,
Isaiah ain’t the kind to break the rust.
But every time fate tips his hat,
He thinks of the day he walked home with that.

[Chorus]
He didn’t mean to win, just a twist of fate,
Now he’s holding firepower in the Lone Star State.
Isaiah laughed and said, “What am I to do?”
With a rifle in hand and a heart so true.
